Monit - utility for monitoring services on a Unix system


"Monit is a utility for managing and monitoring processes, programs,
files, directories and filesystems on a Unix system.  Monit conducts
automatic maintenance and repair and can execute meaningful causal
actions in error situations.  E.g. Monit can start a process if it
does not run, restart a process if it does not respond and stop a
process if it uses too much resources.  You can use Monit to monitor
files, directories and filesystems for changes, such as timestamps
changes, checksum changes or size changes."

#
## Monit has an embedded HTTP interface which can be used to view status of
## services monitored and manage services from a web interface. The HTTP
## interface is also required if you want to issue Monit commands from the
## command line, such as 'monit status' or 'monit restart service' The reason
## for this is that the Monit client uses the HTTP interface to send these
## commands to a running Monit daemon. See the Monit Wiki if you want to
## enable SSL for the HTTP interface.
